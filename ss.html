                <h2>Introduction to Scorbot</h2>
            </div>
        </div>
         <div class="content">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p1>        Scorbot E4 RU is a smart educational robot that can do many things. It works even better when it's connected to digital inputs. The digital signals to the controller when integrated with the controlling software, scorbase, can move the robot to the pretrained positions. Let u jump into that.
            </p1>
            <h4>Scorbot</h4>
            <p2>        Scorbot, a leading robotic platform developed by Intelitek, embodies versatility and precision in its design and functionality. With its multiple degrees of freedom and adaptable end-effectors, Scorbot manipulators excel in performing intricate tasks across various industries. Renowned for their reliability and user-friendly interfaces, Scorbot arms empower users to program and deploy robotic solutions with ease. Whether in manufacturing, education, or research, Scorbot's intuitive design and advanced capabilities make it a preferred choice for applications demanding precision and efficiency in robotic operations.

            <h5>Controller</h5>
            <p3>   The controller in Scorbot is like its brain and backbone combined. It's what makes everything work smoothly. This controller isn't just a passive part; it actively interacts with both analog and digital devices outside the robot. It takes orders from the Scorbase software, the control program for the robot, and turns them into real-world actions. Plus, it provides the power needed to make the robot move effectively. With analog and digital inputs, it can connect to various sensors and switches, giving Scorbot the ability to sense and respond to its surroundings. Whether it's picking up objects or avoiding obstacles, the controller ensures Scorbot operates accurately and reliably.

            <h4>Scorbase</h4>
            <p4>    Scorbase, the proprietary software accompanying Scorbot robotic arms, serves as the digital brain that drives their functionality. With Scorbase, users gain access to a comprehensive programming interface that simplifies the deployment and control of Scorbot manipulators. This software enables seamless integration of Scorbot into diverse workflows, offering tools for trajectory planning, task sequencing, and real-time monitoring. Whether programming complex automation routines or teaching new tasks through intuitive interfaces, Scorbase empowers users to unleash the full potential of Scorbot robotics with efficiency and precision.

            <p13>Lets checkout how we can teach or train the Scorbot its position:</p13>
            <pre></pre>
            <p14>First you need to open the Scorbase, then go to file and select new project.</p14> 
            <pre></pre>
            <img src="3.png" alt="Image" class="center">
            <pre></pre>
            <p10>Now you can see many options on the right side and a blank white box on the right side which is where you write your code. Before jumping directly into code, let me explain me some command which are going to use. As you can see, I selected an option  called label. Label can be said as a function. Inside label we can write our instructions and conditions.</p10> 
            <img src="6.png" alt="Image" class="center">
            <pre></pre>
            <p11>Here you can see If input box. With this we can add condition to our functions</p11>            
            <img src="8.png" alt="Image" class="center">
            </p4>
            <pre></pre>
            <p6>Here I labelled MOVEMENT 1, put WAIT condition, Added an instruction , now I want to add or teach a position so that the robot could move to that position. Make sure you select online from the options on the menu bar before performing this, cause only after that you could move your robot. Before starting training press the home on the menu bar. Now for setting positions you can see just below the text editor, a box called manual movement in which you could see many button 1,2,3,Q,W,E..etc. Using that you could move the robot. After moving the robot go to teach position mark it as 1 or what ever you want and click on the blue robot symbol, for ensuring the position you moved the robot is recorded.</p6>
             <pre></pre>
            <img src="7.png" alt="Image" class="center">
            <p7>Now you could you use Go To Position to set target positions to move the robot. You can write your own code with these much commands. After that you can execute the program by clicking run>>single/continues cycle.</p7>

            <p9>Here I will provide you with a code which I wrote to run my robot,</p9>
            <pre></pre>
            <pre>
             INPUTS:
            If Input 1 Off Jump to MOV1 
            If Input 2 Off Jump to MOV2 
            If Input 3 Off Jump to MOV3 
            If Input 4 Off Jump to MOV4 
            Jump to INPUTS
            MOV1: 
            Go to Postion 1 Speed 10
            Jump to INPUTS 
            MOV2: 
            Go to Postion 2 Speed 10 
            Jump to INPUTS 
            MOV3: 
            Go to Postion 3 Speed 10 
            Jump to INPUTS 
            MOV4:
            Go to Postion 4 Speed 10 
            Jump to INPUTS
            </pre>

            <p8>The logic of this code is very simple. The code keeps checking if there is any inputs coming at the input pins. And whenever there is a digital input is entered into any of the digital input pins of the controller the robot moves its arm to the targeted position. After executing the instruction it will keep on checking. The jump to condition after the if conditions makes a loop to monitor  continuously. If it finds something, jump to label named mov1 or to others. Then back to first label that is input after executing it.</p8>

            <p11>Here are some positions which I trained my robot to move.</p11>
            <img src="Col.jpg" alt="Image" class="center">
            <p12>For input digital signals, I wrote a code in Arduino ide and chose a Arduino Uno as my input option. The code is wrote in such a way that whenever I press either a,b,c or d, it will makes or out digital pins 10,11,12 or 13 high respectively. There is a delay of 3 seconds in each condition, so that for that much time the pin stays high.</p12>

    <p16>Here is the Arduino ide serial monitor and terminal, which I enters the value.</p16>
    <img src="2.jpg" alt="Image" class="center">
    <p18>If you look at the controller after giving connections from the digital pins of arduino to controller, you could see all the LEDs corresponding to the pins get high or on. If its not,then check if ground is given. When you enter a,b,c or d as commands in the terminal, you could see the LEDs of the controller blinks. This denotes that a voltage of 5 volt or near is getting supplied to the digital pin of the controller. If its not changing then check the supply with a multimeter to ensure the supply is there and check if the connections are proper. You can also use any versions of Arduino board or Node MCU or even Raspberry Pi. The only condition is a volatge ranging from 3-5 volt should be provided. </p18>
